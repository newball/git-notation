#Git Notation

Git Notation is a project aimed at improving commit messages to easily sort through commit messages, find specific issues, and better manage what has been done throughout the course of a projects lifespan.

## Description

Commit messages should begin with a character flag indicating the type of commit that has been submitted. These character flags are the +, -, ~, !, and * symbols. These characters  should be used at the beginning of a commit to indicate the type of commit that has been processed. 

## Examples

Here are some current examples of what a few git commit messages look like in WordPress (my favorite open source platforms):

- [Themes: enable browser history support in add new theme screen.](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/33286df4c10f9db9e438ded1b074a0c6463c6863)
- About page: Remove `autoplay` and `loop` attributes on "Theme Starter Content", "Edit Shortcuts", and "Video Headers" videos, originally added as a part of [39512].
- [REST API: Do not allow access to users from a different site in multisite.](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/eb8457d3f489e51bc457604a7744d8eb541707ae)
- [Taxonomy: Improve 'Parent' label when editing taxonomy terms.](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/b6572af5d227103f185e5646394644837755a694)
- [REST API: Fix multiple issues with setting dates of posts and comments.](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/b6ce4e283080332525bb276e2bacaf566c4a9b5c)
- [FINALLY](https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress/commit/a939c7571a9a3f833180f83c7e084b78b26a2b83)

By using my suggestion of Git Notation, these commits would look like this:

- \+ Themes: enable browser history support in add new theme screen.
- \- About page: Remove `autoplay` and `loop` attributes on "Theme Starter Content", "Edit Shortcuts", and "Video Headers" videos, originally added as a part of [39512].
- \- REST API: Do not allow access to users from a different site in multisite.
- ~ Taxonomy: Improve 'Parent' label when editing taxonomy terms.
- \! REST API: Fix multiple issues with setting dates of posts and comments.
- \* FINALLY

## Specification Detail

The recommendation is to use the Git Notation flag, followed by a space, taking up no more than the first two characters of a commit message. After these two characters, simply write the rest of your commit message as normal, using your preferred commit notation standards.

- \+ (plus symbol): the plus symbol indicates an addition and can include any sort of addition such as: new features, files, functions, etc. The idea here is to indicate something has been added to the project.
- \- (minus symbol): the minus symbol indicates a removal and can include any sort of removal such as: removing a feature, files, function, etc. The idea here is to indicate something has been removed from the project.
- ~ (squiggly symbol): the (squiggly) symbol indicates a change. Think of this as a combination of + and -. Often, in the development process, there are changes to code that isn’t merely an addition or a removal, it’s a new way of thinking or processing data. This is really important when a function or feature has been depreciated. This notation should be used when indicating these changes and depreciations. 
- ! (Exclamation mark): the exclamation mark indicates a fix to a bug/issue or comment. This is different than the change, as it points directly to an issue or comment that has been raised in the development process. Think of this as a way of directly responding to things that arise in the development process.
- \* (star symbol): the star symbol indicates a comment. Use this to comment in a project what ever one feels is relevant. Some of these comments can be as simple as indicating the first commit or a notation that's important to the project development.
